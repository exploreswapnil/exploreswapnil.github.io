    <h4>dive, breathe and live (devOps)</h4>
</div>
<p> devOps definition resides behind, collaborative approach in releasing the build in production (or making it
    live to the end users) going through developers, testers, and the operations team. it does involve other
    factors as well, we will catch up to those as well in our sectioned articles but for now i wanted to relate
    devOps with life. how its actually residing in our lives and we somehow are living in it but have never
    thought on this.

    <br><br>you must be wondering how, so just take a moment and go through the title of this writing and try to
    compare the three major components of devOps with arguments defined above.

    <br><br>this is it, three arguments to pass in under the function so called life(). if it compiles and
    executes
    successfully we feel its perfect and we are living it. but life is lived when you deal with compilation
    errors, run time execution exceptions (failures) and what not, because at that moment, you recheck, go
    through the whole code, debug it and then when its done and runs perfectly, there you are, this is the best
    moment you live.

    <br><br>hi, Swapnil this side, a devOps person, QA, blogger, loves to sing, nature is always my love, but
    when
    it comes with my friends its perfect. i love being into the mountains, listening to soothing songs, making
    full night conversations and what notâ€¦

    <br><br>for me this site will be more of a learning but at the same time it will consist of my articles that
    may
    or may not relate to any technical topics and you are all welcome to read them and share your views
