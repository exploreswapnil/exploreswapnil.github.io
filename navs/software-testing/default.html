                According to ANSI/IEEE 1059 standard, Testing is defined as the process of analyzing a software item to
                detect the differences between existing and required conditions (that is defects/errors/bugs) and to
                evaluate the features of the software item.

                <h4>Why Software Testing?</h4>
                So, the question arises, why is there a need to test a software?
                <div class="vertical-space"></div>
                Scenario 1: No testing is performed on an application, its live for the users and bunch of users are
                using at the same time, after a few minutes or so, the application crashes and does not run until is
                resinstalled
                <div class="vertical-space"></div>
                Cause of Issue: Since the application was never tested, the gap was never filled, and by gap i mean the
                scenario at which the application tends to crash
                <div class="vertical-space"></div>
                Scenario 2: The user starts using the application, he/she browses a few areas of the application and
                even with the best of functionalities, fast in terms of performances, they remove or stop using it
                <div class="vertical-space"></div>


                Cause of Issue: The User Experience part now a days is very important while building any application,
                from the very small to large scale ones, if the user is not loving using it, he wont stay longer.
                <div class="vertical-space"></div>
                There can be many such scenarios, but from the above two, you can see why testing is important, I am
                laying out some of the major applications of Software Testing (reference for the applications is taken
                from here)
                <div class="vertical-space"></div>
                Cost Effective Development
                <div class="vertical-space"></div>
                Product improvement
                <div class="vertical-space"></div>
                Test Automation
                <div class="vertical-space"></div>
                Quality check

                <div class="vertical-space"></div>
                <div class="vertical-space"></div>
                So, now the question arises, who does it? who performs the testing, answer is, it actually depends on
                the process and associated members of the project. Each member resides the responsibility of testing the
                application in one way or another. We have the developers performing Unit testing on their code,
                Software testers to test the application in more than one type (depending on the requirement which is
                based on the time span and the criticality sometimes as well). The Project Lead or the manager sometimes
                performs the UAT (User acceptance testing) and so on.
